[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/MafoloEmmanuel/greetings-webapp.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/MafoloEmmanuel/greetings-webapp)
 The app can be found on heroku at https://greetings-expressjsapp.herokuapp.com/

This is a web app that allows a user to enter a name and select a language that they would like to be greeted in. Greetings will then display on the screen and it shows how many names are already greeted.
You can also see how many times each name had been greeted.
